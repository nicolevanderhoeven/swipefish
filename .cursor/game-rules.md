# 💘 SWIPEFISH — Core Ruleset

A party storytelling game about dating, deception, and disastrously mismatched profiles.

---

# 🎯 OBJECTIVE
Collect the most **Match Points** by the end of the game.

You gain points by:
- Being selected by the Swiper as their best match  
- Successfully swipefishing the Swiper (if you are the Swipefish)  
- Correctly identifying the Swipefish (optional guessing phase)

---

# 👥 OVERVIEW
Each round, one player becomes the **Swiper**—a dater with:
- A **Role** (public)
- A **Goal** (secret)

The other players are **Matches** trying to impress the Swiper.

One Match is secretly assigned as the **Swipefish**:
- The only person besides the Swiper who knows the Swiper’s secret Goal  
- They can tailor their answers to perfectly match what the Swiper wants  
- They are trying to be chosen *without revealing themselves*

Everyone else:
- Is a Match  
- Is guessing what the Swiper might want  
- Is trying to either get chosen OR help identify the Swipefish

---

# 📦 COMPONENTS
- **Role Cards** (public personas for the Swiper)
- **Goal Cards** (what the Swiper is secretly looking for)
- **Prompt Cards** (sentence starters the Swiper reads aloud)
- **Phrase Cards** (answers the matches play)
- **App** (optional) to randomize and manage assignments

# ▶️ ROUND STRUCTURE

## 1. Assign the Swiper
Rotate clockwise or let the app choose randomly.

The Swiper draws:
- **1 Role Card** (revealed publicly)
- **1 Goal Card** (kept secret)

The Role defines how the Swiper introduces themselves;  
the Goal defines what they’re secretly seeking in a match.

Example:  
- **Role:** “Crypto Bro”  
- **Goal:** “Looking for my lifelong partner”

The Swiper reads the Role aloud and introduces themselves in character (briefly).  
They may describe what they’re looking for, **without naming the Goal.**

---

## 2. Assign the Swipefish
The app (or deck) secretly selects **one** Match to be the Swipefish.

The Swipefish sees the Swiper’s **Goal**.

Nobody else does.

**Swipefish Objective:**  
Get chosen by the Swiper without being detected.

---

## 3. Swiper Selects a Prompt
The Swiper draws **3 Prompt Cards**, chooses **1**, and reads it aloud.

Example:  
> “On Saturdays, I like to get up early and…”

This becomes a sentence for the Matches to complete.

---

## 4. Matches Play a Phrase Card
Each Match draws **5 Phrase Cards**.

They choose **1** to play face-down (or submit privately via app).

One by one, players:
- Reveal their Phrase Card  
- Read it aloud  
- Give a short “explanation” as to why their answer fits the prompt  

The Swipefish will tailor their answer to align with the Swiper’s Goal.

---

## 5. Swiper Selects the Best Match
After all answers are revealed, the Swiper picks their favorite—the one that:
- Best aligns with the (hidden) Goal  
- Best fits the prompt  
- Or is simply the funniest or most appealing  

**Scoring:**
- Selected player: **+2 Match Points**  
- If the selected player was the Swipefish:  
  - Swipefish earns an additional **+2 Match Points** (total +4)  
  - Swiper loses **-1 Match Point** (“You got swipefished”)

---

## 6. Reveal the Goal
The Swiper now reveals their secret Goal.

This is usually funny, surprising, or damning.

---

## 7. Reveal the Swipefish (Optional Guessing Phase)
Before the Swipefish is revealed, players may point at who they believe the Swipefish was.

Then the Swipefish announces themselves.

**Scoring (optional):**
- Each correct guesser: **+1 Match Point**  
- Swipefish earns **+1 Match Point** for every incorrect guess

If you want the lightest ruleset, omit this phase.

---

## 8. End of Round
Discard all played cards.  
Rotate to the next Swiper.  
Begin the next round.

Game continues until:
- Everyone has been the Swiper once (short game)  
- Everyone has been the Swiper twice (long game)  
- Or a chosen number of rounds

---

# 🏆 WINNING THE GAME
At the end, the player with the **most Match Points** wins.

**Tie-breaker:**
1. Most correct Swipefish guesses  
2. Most successful Swipefish rounds  
3. Sudden-death bonus prompt (or rock-paper-scissors)
