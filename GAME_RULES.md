Swipefish Game Rules v0.1

High-Level Description
Dating is hard! This is a hilarious dating-app game where players must match quirky personalities with each other. Careful of the quirks though! Not every crazy is going to match every life goal.

Overview
- Multiplayer card game with visible personas and hidden quirks.
- Players take turns as the Swiper, choosing matches and scoring.

Components
- Persona deck: finite set of face-up persona cards.
- Quirk deck: hidden quirks paired with personas in sleeves.
- Each player holds a hand of persona+quirk pairs.

Setup
- Each player starts with N persona+quirk pairs in hand.
- Persona faces are visible; quirks stay hidden in sleeves.
- The persona deck is the draw source; the game ends when it is empty.

Turn Flow
1) Swiper plays one persona+quirk pair from hand (persona face up, quirk hidden).
2) Each other player submits one persona+quirk pair face down (persona face up, quirk hidden).
3) Swiper selects one submission as the match.
4) Non-chosen players take their submitted cards back into hand.
5) Chosen player scores 1 point and draws a new persona+quirk pair.
6) Swiper reveals both quirks (their own and the chosen card) and explains why it works or fails.

Quirk Resolution
- If quirks match:
  - Swiper scores 2 points.
  - Both cards are removed as a scored pair.
  - Swiper draws two new persona+quirk pairs.
- If quirks do not match:
  - Swiper takes both persona+quirk pairs into their hand.
  - The chosen player keeps their 1 point and replacement.
  - The mismatched cards remain with the Swiper until replayed later.

Rotation
- Swiper role passes to the next player each round.

Game End
- The game ends when the persona deck is empty.
- Highest total score wins.

Notes
- N (starting hand size) is TBD.
- Quirks are always hidden until the Swiper reveals them during resolution.
