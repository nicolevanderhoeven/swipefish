# Swipefish Game Rules

## Introduction

Swipefish is a social deduction game for 3 players, inspired by Werewolf and Mafia, but themed around online dating. Players must use their wits and social skills to identify the Swipefish among them before time runs out.

## Objective

- **Matches**: Work together to identify and vote to "Ghost" (Swipe Left on) the Swipefish before the timer ends.
- **Swipefish**: Blend in with the Matches and avoid being Ghosted.

## Roles

### Matches (2 players)
You are genuine matches looking for a real connection. Your goal is to identify the Swipefish and vote to Ghost them. You know there is one other Match, but you don't know who they are.

### Swipefish (1 player)
You are a catfish trying to avoid detection. Your goal is to convince the Matches that you're one of them, so they Ghost someone else instead. If you survive the vote, you win.

## Setup

1. Three players join the game.
2. Each player is randomly assigned a role: either Match or Swipefish.
3. Roles are kept private—only you know your own role.
4. Once all three players indicate they're ready, the game begins.

## Gameplay

### Discussion Phase (10 minutes)

Once all players are ready, a 10-minute timer starts. During this time:

- Players can freely discuss and debate who they think is the Swipefish.
- All players can see each other's messages in real-time.
- Use this time to ask questions, share suspicions, and build your case.
- Remember: the Swipefish is trying to blend in, while the Matches are trying to identify them.

### Voting Phase

When the 10-minute timer expires:

- All players must vote by "Swipe Left" on one player they believe is the Swipefish.
- This vote represents "Ghosting" that player.
- Each player votes independently and privately.
- You cannot vote for yourself.

## Win Conditions

### Matches Win
The Matches win if the majority of players (at least 2 out of 3) vote to Ghost the Swipefish.

### Swipefish Wins
The Swipefish wins if they are not Ghosted (i.e., if the majority of votes go to someone else, or if there's a tie that doesn't result in the Swipefish being Ghosted).

## End Game

After all votes are cast:

1. The results are revealed to all players.
2. Each player's role is disclosed.
3. The winner is announced:
   - If the Swipefish was Ghosted: **Matches win!**
   - If the Swipefish was not Ghosted: **Swipefish wins!**

## Strategy Tips

- **For Matches**: Pay attention to inconsistencies in stories, suspicious behavior, or players who seem too eager to accuse others. Work together (without revealing you're both Matches) to identify the Swipefish.
- **For Swipefish**: Act natural, ask questions, and try to redirect suspicion toward one of the Matches. Blend in by participating actively in the discussion.
